<h2>Potenetial Issues</h2>
<ol>
<li>Recreating the URLs with variables could be tricky</li>
<li>Have never scraped based on user input before, only based on real values.</li>
<li>Little experience with creating forms in python, not a strength of mine.</li>
<li>Creating plan to crawl the ensuing pages after a search is triggered</li>
<li>Gonna have to figure out how caching, writing to a csv, and writing to a DB can all work together.</li>
<li>App Routes are gonna require more careful investigation into what will work</li>
<li>This could be a completely impossible task with what I know about Python, Flask, etc.</li>
</ol>
